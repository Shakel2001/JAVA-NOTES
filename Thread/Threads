Threads in Java - Study Notes
Basics
A Thread is a lightweight process.

Java supports multithreading: executing multiple threads simultaneously.

The main class to work with threads is from the java.lang package.

Sequential Programming
Executes instructions one after another.

Not efficient for concurrent tasks like file copy, sorting, etc.

Creating Threads in Java
Two Ways:
By Extending the Thread Class

Override the run() method.

Call the start() method to begin thread execution.

java
Copy
Edit
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        // thread task
    }
}
MyThread t = new MyThread();
t.start();
By Implementing the Runnable Interface

Implement the run() method.

Pass the object to a Thread instance and call start().

java
Copy
Edit
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        // thread task
    }
}
Thread t = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
t.start();
